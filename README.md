# GifTastic

I completed this application as an assignment in coding bootcamp. I used the GIPHY API to make a dynamic web page that populates with gifs.


Assignment Instructions:

The app should take the topics in this array and create buttons in HTML.

When the user clicks on a button, the page grabs 10 static, non-animated gif images from the GIPHY API and places them on the page.

When the user clicks one of the still GIPHY images, the gif animates. If the user clicks the gif again, it stops playing.
